      The Wii Room browser is a fairly stripped back browser. You'll have to
      program in your own refresh, and previous and next buttons due to the lack
      of them in the ui. The browser is slow when it comes to rendering lots of
      images, so try to cut back on images. Also, the browser has a chance of
      randomly erroring because of image stuff. I would have put this little guy
      on the main page, but I was worried it would cause a crash. Speaking of
      him, the browser is very weird about gifs. If the gif is "too small"
      (below around 150px of width and height) it will not play properly, only
      playing when you scroll.
